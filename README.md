On December 10th, Cyberpunk2077 was released around 9 years after garnering overwhelming hype and support. However, the release was met with harsh criticism from gaming journalists and gamers alike for its buggy and almost unplayable state for console users. On Reddit and major gaming review websites, Cyberpunk2077 continued to recieve complaints and negative press to the point that CD Projekt Red (studio of Cyberpunk2077) was issuing refunds for the game. In this project, I wanted to see if reputation of the game was as poor as what was being reflected in mainstream media. To get a clearer image of the games reputation, I did a sentiment analysis on the tweets related to Cyberpunk2077 five days before and after release. Did these negative, vocal opinions represent the majority or were most gamers silently enjoying the game despite the negative reviews? 

## Main Packages and Libraries Used 
- Seaborn 
- Matplotlib 
- Vader Sentiment 

## Key Takeaways + Conclusion 
Cyberpunk2077, as of now, is still receiving positive feedback and the general populace is enjoying the game. Even with the constant negative press that the game got, majority of people are having positive experiences with the game. Cyberpunk2077 did not crash and burn, as some people expected and there could be a number of reasons why the game is performing well despite the controversies: 

1. The number of pre-orders were in the millions (est. 8 million copies from pre-orders alone) --> could have boosted positive sentiment as there is a large group of dedicated fans 


2. CD Projekt Red is continually patching and fixing the game to make the game more playable 


3. The studio admitted their mistakes and issued refunds without question or regard to playtime, which can be seen as deep sense of remorse from the company's side. As a result, they won back some lost trust with customers. 


4. The number of tweets that I scraped was simply not enough to get the complete picture 


5. Cyberpunk2077 marketing did a fantastic job in making die-hard fans that would overlook the bugs and flaws of the game. Essentially, customers are trying to justify their sunk-cost into the game (time, money, and unrealistic expectations).
